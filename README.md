FEATURES
1.Permanent burn in black hole. we will burn 50% of the total  supply after of $SByte launch and send it to a  black hole address. As this address also  participates in the protocol, it  accumulates more tokens, effectively  removing them from circulation.It helps in scarcity of SECURABYTE.
2.Auto-locking liquidity 5% of each transaction is locked to  liquidity forever. This contributes to  lower volatility and a continuously  increasing price floor.
3. Staking rewards In BNB or BUSD
Securabyte also in plans to have a diffrent staking system in which $Sbyte stakers can earn BUSD or BNB as rewards depends upon availability of funds.
